# CSGOLiveUI (Under development)

*A custom CSGO spectator UI with implementation of GSI*

---

## Used library

csgo-gsi: https://github.com/koczadly/csgo-gsi

OpenJFX: https://openjfx.io/

## Misc

I strongly recommend MacType to be used during the running of CSGOLiveUI to provide anti-alias for font to improve the appearance.
